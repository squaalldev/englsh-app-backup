# Headline Booster

Headline Booster is a small-model-ready Gradio chatbot that helps entrepreneurs create clearer, stronger headlines in seconds.

## What it does

The user gives four simple pieces of information:
1. What they sell
2. Who it is for
3. The result the audience wants
4. How many headlines they want

The app then generates persuasive headline options.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
